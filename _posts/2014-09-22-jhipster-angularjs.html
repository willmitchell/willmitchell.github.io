<p>I have been spending some time with <a href="http://jhipster.github.io/" target="_blank">JHipster</a>.  I like it.</p>
<p>Java developers looking to adopt <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> should check consider JHipster as a great way to get started.</p>
<p>Below is a snapshot of the Google Trend chart showing JHipster's impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have not heard of AngularJS, consider the following chart that shows how even JHipster's spike pales in comparison to the wave of interest in AngularJS.  JHipster is in blue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, consider how both of the above spikes seem small compared to Java's relatively steady and huge mindshare.  I think these charts offer some clues as to where things are headed in Java-land.</p>
