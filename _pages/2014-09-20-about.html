<p>Hi.  I am Will Mitchell, a software developer.  I build high performance software teams.  I spent most of the last decade leading a number of software development research and development projects at Noblis, where we did some solid work in biometrics, graph analytics, and Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I am currently running a startup in the housing rentals space.  As a part of this process, I am growing a team with top-notch skills in application development.  We are available for select consulting assignments.</p>
<p>Some people in the software field may say that "mobile changes everything"; but my view is that mobile was the thing that caused the web platform itself to change.  Modern apps are different than websites; they are apps the truly run in the browser.  The way these apps (called Single Page Applications) is very different than the way we used to build websites.  This is a once-per decade sort of shift, in my opinion.</p>
<p>App3 is all about bringing new and profitable business ideas to life.</p>
