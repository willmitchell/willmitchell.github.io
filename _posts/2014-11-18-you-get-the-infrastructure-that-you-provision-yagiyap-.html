<p>We have all heard that "<a title="You get what you pay for" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/you+get+what+you+pay+for" target="_blank">You get what you pay for</a>."</p>
<p>My thought is that we need to apply a similar set of values when we consider our relationship to most impactful transactions that we engage in.  Consider the following types of transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buying a house</li>
<li>Renting a house</li>
<li>Buying cell phone service</li>
<li>Buying cloud computing services</li>
<li>Buying health insurance</li>
<li>Going to a doctor</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though the world of science and technology moves forwards by leaps and bounds, our real world institutions and the related processes continue to rely on models of responsibility that are antiquated.</p>

<p>To be perfectly blunt, my thinking here is that people need to accept some responsibility.  If you do not like your choices in terms of infrastructure, consider why the right infrastructure does not exist.</p>
<p>Are you willing to pay for infrastructure that protects your privacy, or do you rely on your "no-cost" relationship with an internet giant to handle that for you?</p>
